# Wavelet-WAI

## Overview
This project provides a Python-based toolkit for performing Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) analysis on (time-)series data. The toolkit is designed to facilitate signal processing, feature extraction, and visualization of wavelet coefficients, making it ideal for researchers and engineers working in fields such as signal processing, time-frequency analysis, and data science. 
It introduces the **Wavelet Area Interpretation (WAI)**, a visual approach to interpret wavelet coefficients based on areas contributing to their calculation, and exapands on possible applications in ecology.

The repository includes, in matlab and python:

- A core implementation of the Continuous Wavelet Transform (fully customizable)
- Utility functions for handling data and wavelet coefficients.
- An implementation of the WAI, for time-series (in matlab/python) or any type of data (python only)
- Example Jupyter notebook (python) or script (matlab) to demonstrate usage and possible applications.

## Features

- Wavelet Transform: Perform CWT on series data using customizable wavelets.
- Scalogram Visualization: Generate scalograms to visualize wavelet coefficients.
- Data Utilities: Preprocess and manage series data for analysis.
- Wavelet Area Interpretation: Analyze and interpret wavelet coefficients for feature extraction.
- Extensibility: Modular design allows easy integration with other projects.

## Repository structure and installation
See the "matlab" or "python" README.md files for explanations depending on language used.

## Usage
See example files (python/notebooks/Example.ipynb or matlab/scripts/Example_Script.m) for a detailed case-study. For a more guided analysis, refering to the notebook is recommended.
